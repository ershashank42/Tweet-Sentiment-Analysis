# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis of live tweets made by user.

In this project, we can analyze the sentiment of thw tweets made by user on twitter.com
It uses the python module known as Tweepy from which I imported libraries like API, streaming etc for streaming the live tweets from twitter. 
It can also be used to visualize the tweets based on metrics like how many retweets are made on a particular tweet or how many likes a tweet has got in a specified period of time.

It also uses pandas and numpy for storing the data from JSON formatted dictionary object into dataframe for analysis.
For sentiment analysis TextBlob library is used which is a trained library in python which classifies a tweet as positive, negative or a neutral tweet.
